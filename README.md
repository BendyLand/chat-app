# Chat App

This repository will hold projects that take the form of a chat app. 

It will be implemented in various languages, each one for a specific purpose.

## Languages

- Scala
    - To practice programming in my language of choice. 
- Kotlin
    - Because Scala isn't as popular in the job market...
- Elixir
    - To implement a fairly simply concurrency aspect. 
- Rust
    - To prioritize performance critical aspects and/or dive deeper into concurrency manually. 

## Objectives

By the time I am finished with this project, I would like to have gained a more complete understanding of the technologies involved in it. For example, I currently (at the start) do not really know anything about networking. By the end, it would probably be good for me to have a general understanding of things like TCP/IP, sockets, and HTTP protocols. This is also a bit larger of a project than I have implemented before, so I am hoping that it will help me practice organization and maintaining clear logic over a larger scale.
